ElectronicsCourses
==================

Programms for my electronics courses.

This is for proofread of my homework. They are built with Simulinkï¼Œ which belongs to Mathworks.

The names of these slx files should explain which problems they are related to.

The scope near the shematic shows the result. I offer a snapshot for every model so you can preview the result.

Some further explanations are provided by Max on [his blog](http://romax.me/).

Notes
-----------------

> Electronics_II_ch1_1_9_a, Electronics_II_ch1_1_9_b, Electronics_II_ch1_1_10_b, Electronics_II_ch1_1_10_c use SimPowerSystem. 
> And I made ideal switch enabled.

>> And the following models use Simscape elements.

>> However, with Simscape I found nothing like ideal elements. And I need to use Diode so I set the forward voltage to 0.01V.
>> The result is quite satisfactory.

### Electronics_II_ch1_1_11_c
	The current is quite small for Diode2 but it is through.
